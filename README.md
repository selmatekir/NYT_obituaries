# NYT_obituaries

A corpus of 5210 preprocessed NYT obituaries.

We collected the articles published between 2014 and September 2019 from the NYT obituaries using the NYT API and web scraping. 

The NYT API includes article id, article summary, title, author, publication date, category, number of words, and keywords information. Using web scraping, we also retrieved the article text. 

We extracted the name, surname, gender, age, and occupation of the person mentioned in the obituary.

The final dataset consists of 5210 articles, where 4002 of them belong to males, and the remaining belong to females.
